Use truth tables to prove that the following argument is valid.

Premises: p → q, q → ¬r
Conclusion: p → ¬r

Explain from your results why we know the argument is valid.

want to show that every time ALL the premises are true
then the conclusion is also true
          *       *        *

p q r | p → q | q → ¬r | p → ¬r

--------------------------------

THe argument is valid because every truth assignment that makes
all the premises true (the ones marked with <---) also makes
the conclusion true.


(How do we show an argument is *invalid*?)

Just need ONE truth assignment where all the premises are true
but the conclusion is false

//////////////////
Satisfiability: a statement is satisfiable if I can find ONE
truth assignment that makes it evaluate to true


Not satisfiable: need FULL truth table to show every truth
assignment makes it false (would be a contradictory statement)
