Exam 2:
- Thursday, March 7 9:30-10:45 Ackert 120
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with
    negation rules (!e, !i, _|_e, pbc)
--> still expected to be familiar with all other rules

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive), Z (integers), R (reals)
    - union, intersection, difference, subsets
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets
        of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic (deduction rules
    with quantifiers)
- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent


--> how to prepare?
    get out paper
    work through old homework problems
    work through old lecture example

--> homework solutions

Work through practice exam (will post solution after class)
