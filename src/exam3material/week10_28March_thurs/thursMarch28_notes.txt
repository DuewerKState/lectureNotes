Proof by contrapositive

--> Also for proving things of the form "If P, then Q"

What is the contrapositive of P->Q?

    !Q -> !P



Proof by contrapositive template:

Assume !Q
...
Goal: !P


//////////////////////////////////////////

Example (contrapositive)

If x^2 is odd for an integer x, then x is odd.

    Think of as P->Q
        P: x^2 is odd (x is an integer)
        Q: x is odd
        Contrapositive:
            If x is not odd for an integer x, then x^2 is not odd


Try direct proof first.
    Assume x^2 is odd for some integer x. Since x^2 is odd, then
    x^2 = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

    ..we get stuck, since we would need a square root.

We will use contrapositive instead!



Proof (contrapositive). Assume x is not odd for some integer x.
Since x is not odd, it must be even, and so x = 2k for some integer
k. We have that:
    x^2 = (2k)^2            (squaring both sides)
        = 4k^2
        = 2(2k^2)

Thus x^2 = 2m where m is the integer 2k^2. This means that x^2
is even, and so x^2 is not odd.


--> best to indicate in proof that you are using contrapositive

/////////////////////////////

Example (contrapositive)

Suppose x ∈ Z. If 7x+9 is even, then x is odd.

    Contrapositive: If some integer x is not odd,
        then 7x+9 is not even.


Try direct proof first.

    Suppose 7x+9 is even for some integer x. Then 7x+9 = 2k
    for some integer k.

    Solving for x, x=(2k-9)/7

    Again, we get stuck. Can we even divide by 7?


Proof (contrapositive). Assume x is not odd for some integer x.
Then x must be even, and so x = 2k for some integer k. We have:
    7x + 9 = 7(2k) + 9
            = 14k + 9
            = 2(7k + 4) + 1

So 7x+9 = 2m + 1 where m is the integer 7k + 4, and so 7x+9
must be odd, which means it is not even.


/////////////////////////////

Mistakes in proofs.

We want to "prove" that 1 = 2.


"Proof:"
Let a and b be two equal positive integers. We have that:

    1) a = b                    (premise)

    2) a^2 = ab                 (reason? multiply both sides by a)

    3) a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2     (reason? subtract b^2 from both sides)

    4) (a-b)(a+b) = b(a-b)      (reason? factor both sides)

    5) a+b = b                  (reason? divide both sides by a-b)

    6) 2b = b                   (reason? how to a and b compare?
                                we had assumed that a=b.)

    7) 2 = 1                    (reason? divide both sides by b)


What went wrong?

//////////////////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction.

- same idea as pbc in natural deduction

- assume that what you are trying to prove is not true

- try to get a contradiction

- conclude what you are trying to prove is true after all




/////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction template 1 (trying to prove P)


Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, ¬P.
...
C ^ ¬C.

We have a contradiction between C and ¬C, so P must hold.





//////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction template 2 (trying to prove If P, then Q):


Suppose P.
Assume, for the sake of contradiction, ¬Q.
...
C ^ ¬C.
We have a contradiction between C and ¬C, so Q must hold.





///////////////////////////

Example (use proof by contradiction):

If x^2 is even for an integer x, then x is even.

(which template? 2)

Suppose x^2 is even for some integer x. Assume, for the sake
of contradiction, that x is not even. If x^2 is even, then
x^2 = 2k for some integer k. If x is not even, then it must be odd,
so x = 2m + 1 for some integer m.

Squaring both sides of x = 2m + 1 gives us:
    x^2 = (2m+1)^2
        = 4m^2 + 4m + 1
        = 2(2m^2 + 2m) + 1

And so x^2 = 2b + 1 where b is the integer 2m^2 + 2m, which means
that x^2 is odd. This is a contradiction with our assumption that
x^2 is even. Thus x is even.



//////////////////////////

Definitions: "rational" / "irrational"

A number r is *rational* if r = p/q for some integers p and q,
where q ≠ 0.



Any number that is not rational is irrational,
and any number that is not irrational is rational.

//////////////////////////

Example: use proof by contradiction to prove that sqrt(2)
is irrational.

(which template? 1)

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that sqrt(2) is
not irrational, that is, we assume sqrt(2) is rational.

Since sqrt(2) is rational, we can write:
    sqrt(2) = p/q

Where p and q are integers such that q is not 0. We choose p and
q to not have common factors, so that p/q is fully reduced.

Squaring both sides of sqrt(2) = p/q gives us:
    2 = (p/q)^2
        = (p^2) / (q^2)

Multiplying both sides by q^2 gives us:
    2q^2 = p^2

Thus p^2 = 2m where m is the integer q^2, and so p^2 is even by
definition. Using our previous proof, p must also be even.

Since p is even, we can write p = 2b for some integer b. Plugging
p = 2b into our 2q^2 = p^2 equation gives us:

    2q^2 = (2b)^2
        = 4b^2

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

    q^2 = 2b^2

Thus q^2 = 2a where a is the integer b^2, and so q^2 is even
by definition. Again, q is also even by our previous proof.

Since p and q are both even, this means they share 2 as a common
factor. This is a contradiction with our assumption that p and
q not share common factors.

Thus sqrt(2) is irrational.

Proofs with sets.

Prove that A ⊆ B?
    --> how would we express this in predicate logic?

        ∀ x (x ∈ A → x ∈ B)

    --> proof template?

    pick a random individual. Assume that individual is in A,
    prove that the individual is also in B.

Prove that A = B?
    (∀ x (x ∈ A → x ∈ B)) ^ (∀ x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A))


prove A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A

///////////////////////////////

Example.

Prove that {x : x = 4k + 2, k ∈ ℤ} ⊆ {x : x = 2a, a ∈ ℤ}

A = {x : x = 4k + 2, k ∈ ℤ}
B = {x : x = 2a, a ∈ ℤ}

A: 2, 6, 10, ... (elements 2 more than a multiple of 4)
B: all evens

Assume x ∈ A. We must show that x ∈ B.

Since x ∈ A, we have that x = 4k + 2 for some integer k.
We have that:

    x = 4k + 2
        = 2(2k + 1)

Thus x = 2a where a is the integer 2k+1, and so x ∈ B.

Thus A ⊆ B.


///////////////////////////////

Definition: "divides"

Suppose a and b are integers. We say that a *divides* b,
written a | b, if b = ak for some k ∈ Z.

In this case we also say that a is a *divisor* of b,
a is a *factor* of b
and that b is a *multiple* of a.


3 divides 12, 3 | 12

3 is a divisor of 12, 12 is a multiple of 3

(how do we know, by using definition?)
    12 = 3*k, where k = 4

///////////////////////////////

⋂: intersection, means in both

Prove that {x : x ∈ ℤ, 2|x} ⋂ {x : x ∈ ℤ, 3|x} = {x : x = 6a, a ∈ ℤ}

Let A = {x : x ∈ ℤ, 2|x} (A is all even numbers)
Let B = {x : x ∈ ℤ, 3|x} (B is all multiples of 3)
Let C = {x : x = 6a, a ∈ ℤ} (C is all multiples of 6)

First prove that A ⋂ B ⊆ C.

Let x ∈ A ⋂ B. Thus x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Since x ∈ A, we have that
2|x and so x = 2k for some integer k.

Since x ∈ B, we have that 3|x, and so x = 3m for some integer m.

We have that:

    x = 4x - 3x
       = 4(3m) - 3(2k)
       = 12m - 6k
       = 6(2m - k)

Thus x = 6a where a is the integer 2m - k. So x ∈ C.

We have shown that A ⋂ B ⊆ C.




Then prove C ⊆ A ⋂ B.

Let x ∈ C.
...would need to show x ∈ A AND x ∈ B to show in the intersection.
