HW 7: due Tuesday, March 26

Today:
- soundness and completeness of predicate logic
- mathematical induction

//////////////////////////////

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition? Everything we can prove (in natural deduction) is actually true.

    propositional: yes (anything I can prove with natural deduction is also true in truth tables)

    predicate logic: yes




Completeness: definition? We can prove everything that is true.

    propositional: yes (anything that is true in truth tables can also be proved with natural deduction)

    predicate logic: no (different domains might have different arguments that are true vs false)



///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = 5


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = 0 (wraps back around to the beginning)



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on interpretations)


//////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving something involving natural numbers
    1 and up

Base case: prove the statement is true for the first element in
    our domain.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some k in our domain.
    Given that, prove the statement is true for k+1.

--> how will this prove the statement for our entire domain?


**we will do something similar when proving the correctness of loops*



/////////////////////////////////

Example:

Let P(n) be the claim that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


LHS(n) = 1 + 2 + ... + n
RHS(n) = n*(n+1)/2


So to show P(n) holds, we can show that... ?



Try it out first.

n = 1?

LHS(1): ?
RHS(1): ?



n = 2?

LHS(2): ?
RHS(2): ?



n = 3?

LHS(3):
RHS(3):



Proof by induction.


Base case: We must prove that P(n) holds for the smallest possible n, that is , we must prove P(1).
We have that LHS(1) = 1 and RHS(1) = 1*(1+1)/2 = 1. Since LHS(1) = RHS(1), then P(1) holds.

Inductive step: We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that P(k) holds for some fixed positive integer k.
We must prove that P(k+1) holds. If P(k) holds, then LHS(k) = RHS(k). To show P(k+1) holds, we must show that LHS(k+1) = RHS(k+1).

We have that:
    LHS(k+1) = 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1)  //plug in k+1 to LHS
             = LHS(k) + (k+1)           //1+2+...+k is LHS(k)
             = RHS(k) + (k+1)           //LHS(k) = RHS(k) from inductive hypothesis
             = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)         //RHS(k) = k(k+1)/2
             = ...                      //
             = ...                      //
             = ...                      //
             = RHS(k+1)

Thus LHS(k+1_ = RHS(k+1), and so P(k+1) holds.

/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for
    ALL integers?

no - need a starting smallest value


/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.


Let P(n) be the claim that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2nâˆ’1) = n^2.

LHS(n) = 1 + 2 + ... + (2n-1)
RHS(n) = n^2


Proof by induction.

Base case: We must prove that P(1) holds. We have that LHS(1) = 1 and RHS(1) = 1^2 = 1.
Thus LHS(1) = RHS(1) and so P(1) holds.



Inductive step: We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that P(k) holds for some fixed positive integer.
We must show that P(k+1) holds. If P(k) holds, then LHS(k) = RHS(k). To show P(k+1) holds, we must show that LHS(k+1) = RHS(k+1).


/////////////////////////////////

/////////////////////////////////

Example: 3^n - 1 is even.

Let P(n) be the claim that 3^n - 1 is even for all natural numbers n.



n = 3?


what does "even" mean?

//////////////////////////////////

Example: use induction to prove that for any integer n >= 4:

    n! > 2^n


n = 4?
